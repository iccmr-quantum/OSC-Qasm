# OSC-Qasm
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/432225522.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/432225522)

A simple OSC Python interface for executing Qasm code.
(or a simple bridge to connect _The QAC Toolkit_ with real quantum hardware)

## Installation
Before starting, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7+ in your system.
- when using the installer on windows make sure to select the option `Add Python X to PATH`

In order to try our Max patches, make sure you also have [Max](http://cycling74.com) installed, and [_The QAC Toolkit_](http://quantumland.art/qac) Max package available.

Clone or [download](https://github.com/iccmr-quantum/OSC-Qasm/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip this repo.

Open the Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and navigate to the folder  where you saved the repo.
- see here a refresher on how to navigate using the terminal [[1](https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/navigating-the-terminal-a-gentle-introduction--mac-3855)][[2](https://www.macworld.com/article/221277/command-line-navigating-files-folders-mac-terminal.html)]

Create a python virtual environment
- on the terminal, type: `python3 -m venv OSCQasm`
- depending on your system, you may simply use: `python -m venv OSCQasm`

Enter your new python virtual environment
- on mac: `source OSCQasm/bin/activate`
- on windows: `OSCQasm\Scripts\activate`

At the start of your terminal prompt, it should show `(OSCQasm)`, indicating that you're in your new virtual environment.

Update pip and setuptools
- `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools`
- Note: if for some reason you don't have pip, please [install it](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows)

Install qiskit and python-osc
- `pip install qiskit python-osc`

Copy the [osc_qasm-Max](./osc_qasm-Max/) folder to your Max library
- usually located in Documents/Max 8/Library

## Running

First, open a Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and start you python environment.

Then run the python module: `python osc_qasm.py`
Wait until the program outputs the following lines:
```console
================================================
 OSC_QASM by OCH & Itaborala @ QuTune (v1.x.x)
 https://iccmr-quantum.github.io               
================================================
Server Receiving on 127.0.0.1 port PPPP
Server Sending back on x.x.x.x port QQQQ
```
Now you can open the [example.maxpat](example.maxpat) or [osc_qasm.maxhelp](osc_qasm-Max/osc_qasm.maxhelp) in Max 8 and start sending messages with QuantumCircuits in Qasm, to the OSC-Qasm python module.

When you're done working with osc_qasm.py you can leave the virtual environment with
- on mac & windows: `deactivate`

### Additional arguments
You can also set some additional arguments and flags in front of `python osc_qasm.py`:

```console
usage: osc_qasm.py [-h] [--token TOKEN] [--hub HUB] [--group GROUP]
                   [--project PROJECT]
                   [receive_port] [send_port] [ip]

positional arguments:
  receive_port       The port where the osc_qasm.py Server will listen for
                     incoming messages. Default port is 1416
  send_port          The port that osc_qasm.py will use to send messages back
                     to Max. Default port is 1417
  ip                 The IP address where the client (Max/MSP) is located.
                     Default IP is 127.0.0.1 (localhost)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --token TOKEN      If you want to run circuits on real quantum hardware, you
                     need to provide your IBMQ token (see https://quantum-
                     computing.ibm.com/account)
  --hub HUB          If you want to run circuits on real quantum hardware, you
                     need to provide your IBMQ Hub
  --group GROUP      If you want to run circuits on real quantum hardware, you
                     need to provide your IBMQ Group
  --project PROJECT  If you want to run circuits on real quantum hardware, you
                     need to provide your IBMQ Project
  --remote [REMOTE]  Declare this is a remote server. In this case osc_qasm.py will be
                     listenning to messages coming into the network adapter address. If there
                     is a specific network adapter IP you want to listen in, add it as an
                     argument here
```


The `osc_qasm.maxpat` abstraction also allows customization using several attributes and positional arguments. Make sure to check out the help patch and the reference page!

### Network Distribution Mode

Version 1.3.0 brought new options for facilitating distributed network scenarios. There there could be a separate machine running OSC-Qasm as a "server", from which clients could request jobs. Furthermore, the results could be sent to a third machine on the network. To that end, osc_qasm.py has an optional flag/argument called `--remote`. When used, the OSC server will listen to the default IP address of your router or local network instead of "127.0.0.1". Additionally, you could specify another IP address (useful for public connections) as an argument after the flag.

Example:

```console
`$ python osc_qasm.py`
Server Receiving on 127.0.0.1 port 1416

$ python osc_qasm.py --remote
Server Receiving on *your-local-IP-address* port 1416

$ python osc_qasm.py --remote x.y.z.w
Server Receiving on x.y.z.w port 1416
```
